/**
 * 17. Carpet Cost Calculator
 * The Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price of carpeting for
 * rectangular rooms. To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the floor (width times length) by
 * the price per square meter of carpet. For example, the area of the floor that is 12 meters long and 10
 * meters wide is 120 square meters. To cover the floor with a carpet that costs $8 per square meter
 * would cost $960.
 * 1. Write a class with the name Floor. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width
 * and length of type double.
 * The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length of type double and it
 * needs to initialize the fields.
 * In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the length
 * parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.
 * Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * ● Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area
 * (width * length).
